# Exploring Predictors of Titanic Survival Using Logistic Regression

In this notebook, we'll use the Titanic dataset to explore which features best predict whether a passenger survived. We'll focus on **four key features**: **gender**, **passenger class**, **fare paid**, and **age**, and use **logistic regression** to model the probability of survival.

The Titanic dataset is a classic binary classification problem — the outcome variable `survived` is 0 (did not survive) or 1 (survived).
